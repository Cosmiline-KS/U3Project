The base case is going to be when the length of drawing is going to be below a certain point, since each time we make more branches the amount of distance turtle has to draw is cut. 

How much forward the turtle is going to draw, and each time the function is called it divides by 2 the distance it will go 

Get the turtle to do basic drawings, create the base of the tree and one branch split, and then get mutiple branch splits.
